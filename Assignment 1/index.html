        <h2>LYRICS</h2>

        <h3>[Intro: Dan Reynolds]</h3><!-- This heading indicates who is singing the line -->
        <p>Look out for yourself</p><!-- This is what they are singing -->

        <h3>[Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]</h3><!-- This heading indicates who is singing the line -->
        <p>I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows<br>
            For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground<br>
            I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told<br>
            When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned<br>
        </p><!-- This is what they are singing -->

        <h3>[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]</h3><!-- This heading indicates who is singing the line -->
        <p>Tell you you're the greatest<br>
            But once you turn, they hate us<br></p><!-- This is what they are singing -->

        <h3>[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]</h3><!-- This heading indicates who is singing the line -->
        <p>Oh, the misery<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
            Spare the sympathy<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y<br>
            (Look out for yourself)<br>
            My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)<br>
            (Look out for yourself)<br>
            But I'm ready<br></p><!-- This is what they are singing -->

        <h3>[Verse 2: Dan Reynolds]</h3><!-- This heading indicates who is singing the line -->
        <p>Your words up on the wall as you're prayin' for my fall<br>
            And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called<br>
            I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time<br>
            When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic<br></p><!-- This is what they are singing -->

        <h3>[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]</h3><!-- This heading indicates who is singing the line -->
        <p>Tell you you're the greatest<br>
            But once you turn, they hate us<br></p><!-- This is what they are singing -->

        <h3>[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]</h3><!-- This heading indicates who is singing the line -->
        <p>Oh, the misery<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
            Spare the sympathy<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y<br>
            (Look out for yourself)<br>
            My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)<br>
            (Look out for yourself)<br>
            Uh, look, okay<br></p><!-- This is what they are singing -->

        <h3>[Verse 3: JID]</h3><!-- This heading indicates who is singing the line -->
        <p>I'm hopin' that somebody pray for me<br>
            I'm prayin' that somebody hope for me<br>
            I'm stayin' where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted<br>
            Being a wreck of emotions<br>
            Ready to go whenever, just let me know<br>
            The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor<br>
            The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable<br>
            I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"<br>
            They wanna plot on my trot to the top<br>
            I been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut<br>
            I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe<br>
            And it matters more because I had it not<br>
            Had I thought about wreaking havoc<br>
            On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static<br>
            With precision, I'm automatic quarterback<br>
            I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it<br>
            Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up<br>
            Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at your throat<br></p><!-- This is what they are singing -->

        <h3>[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]</h3><!-- This heading indicates who is singing the line -->
        <p>Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
            Spare the sympathy (Ah)<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
            Oh, the misery (Ah)<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
            Spare the sympathy (Ah)<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy<br></p><!-- This is what they are singing -->
